# 🩸 LIFELYNK - Blood Donation Management System

**Theme**: Community and Upliftment  
**Main Motto**: Bridge the gap between blood donors and hospitals, fostering a culture of social responsibility and community care.

---

## 🌐 Overview

**LIFELYNK** is a decentralized web-based platform that revolutionizes the blood donation process by efficiently connecting **registered blood donors** and **hospitals**. The platform is designed to promote **transparency**, **security**, and **community engagement** through a smart and intuitive system backed by blockchain technology.

## 💡 Idea

LIFELYNK allows hospitals to create and publish blood donation requests, which are automatically distributed to nearby potential donors based on location (within a 20 km radius). Donors can view and book requests via their personalized dashboard. Once a donor applies, hospitals can review the application and either approve or reject it. Successful donations are permanently recorded on the blockchain, creating a tamper-proof history and increasing trust in the process.
